# MetricUnits
Easy to use, read, and convert, units of measurement in Swift.

## Do
* Code as if you were writing (`120.kg`)
* Supports operators (subtract, multiply, divide, add)
* Strongly typed (no adding a meter to a week here)
* Display in metric or imperial
* Converts easily (days to hours)
* Supports standard Swift formatting (`let everest = 884_800.00.cm`)

## Don’t
* Swift doesn’t allow `kg` or `kilograms` as a postfix, so `120kg` will never be. (prove me wrong, is there a better way?)

I don’t like imperial, I’m a metric kind of guy. Fork me, make *ImperialUnits*.
